What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
It is a tool that tracks changes in files and directories over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
Git allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without stepping on each other's toes.
