What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
It is a tool that tracks changes in files and directories over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
Git allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without stepping on each other's toes.

Key Concepts:

1-Repository (Repo):
A repository, or repo, is like a folder for your project. It contains all the files and folders related to your project, along with the revision history.
There are two types of repositories: local and remote.
Local repository: stored on your computer.
Remote repository: stored on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

Commit:
A commit is a snapshot of changes made to files in your project at a specific point in time.
Each commit has a unique identifier (hash), a commit message explaining the changes, and a pointer to the previous commit.

Branch:
A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It allows you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main project until you're ready to merge your changes.
The default branch is usually called "master" or "main".

Merge:
Merging combines the changes from one branch into another. It integrates the changes made in separate branches back into the main branch.

Pull Request (PR):
A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.
It allows others to review and discuss the proposed changes before they are merged into the main branch.

Clone:
Cloning creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine, allowing you to work on the project locally.


Basic Workflow:

1- Initialize a Repository:
Create a new repository or clone an existing one.

2-Make Changes:
Edit files in your project.

3-Stage Changes:
Use git add to stage changes for commit.

4-Commit Changes:
Use git commit to save staged changes to the repository.

5-Push Changes:
Use git push to upload local commits to a remote repository.

6-Pull Changes:
Use git pull to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
